# dalle3-api-multiple-requests
The DallE3 API nativly does not allow to request multiple image generations at the same time, as of April 2024. I wrote a small script to circumnavigate that. 
The API management happens in a .env file, that is not included in this project. For more details check out the dotenv library for python.
